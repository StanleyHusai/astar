three frames:  [1]point_cloud map frame   [2]matlab frame   [3]python_matrix frame 
(0,0) in [1] = (150,150)meter in [2] = (300,100) in [3]
(0,0) in frame [2] is at left-bottom corner
(0,0) in frame [3] is at left-top corner

transformation from point_cloud map frame[1] to python_matrix frame[3] 
(0,0)~(300,100)
Add 300 on x, add 100 on y
